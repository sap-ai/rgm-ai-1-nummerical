# rgm-ai-1-nummerical
Use rgmnv-1 or reinforcement generative model numerical version:
make a training set by putting in just numbers and commas at the end of the numbers and spaces until the end, like this "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10" in a file(recommended txt file format), needs python(recommended python version 3.4, or a version that supports all this code in the python file), make sure you have the random library for python, and the math library for python, you may need to know some python bugs to fix them, go into python and go file open rgm-vs1n.py, go to run module there should be an a space where you can type, put your training set file in rgmnv, if you didn't put it's file path in the empty space no "'s if there not a part of the file's name, but if you did put your file name in the space, now the second to last will contain training speeds, and the last should contain results it made with those speeds. This belongs to me so no one can claim they own the idea or own the idea because I want to help benefit America, and the rest of the world.
